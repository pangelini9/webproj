	<h1>Football app</h1>
	<p>Welcome to our first Django web application, where we discuss about football</p>
	<p>For now, we have created some <a href="teams">football teams</a>, using the 
	<a href="admin">admin page</a>.</p>
    <p>Now we have also created a <a href="{% url 'football:players' %}">page </a> to show all the players of Man United.
